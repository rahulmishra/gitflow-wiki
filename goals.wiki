= Goals Overview =
* [[goals/feature-start|jgitflow:feature-start]] Starts a feature branch
* [[goals/feature-finish|jgitflow:feature-finish]] Finishes a feature branch
* [[goals/release-start|jgitflow:release-start]] Starts a release
* [[goals/release-finish|jgitflow:release-finish]] Finishes a release
* [[goals/hotfix-start|jgitflow:hotfix-start]] Starts a hotfix
* [[goals/hotfix-finish|jgitflow:hotfix-finish]] Finishes a hotfix
* [[goals/build-number|jgitflow:build-number]] Updates the pom versions in the current branch by adding a build number label
= Common Parameters =
All of the goals some common configuration parameters defined in ##com.atlassian.maven.plugins.jgitflow.AbstractJGitFlowMojo##. One complex parameter is ##flowInitContext##. Because this is of a complex type, the automatic Maven documentation generation is not so helpful. This parameter permits you to configure branch and tag names, as shows in the following example:
{{{
    <configuration>
      <flowInitContext>
         <masterBranchName>frankenstein</masterBranchName>
         <developBranchName>development</developBranchName>
         <featureBranchPrefix>feature-</featureBranchPrefix>
         <releaseBranchPrefix>release-</releaseBranchPrefix>
         <hotfixBranchPrefix>hotfix-</hotfixBranchPrefix>
         <versionTagPrefix>blither-</versionTagPrefix>
       </flowInitContext>
     </configuration>
}}}

With this configuration, the 'master' branch is named 'frankenstein', the 'develop' branch is named 'development'. Feature branches are named 'feature-Whatever' instead of feature/whatever, release branches 'release-Version' instead of 'release/Version', and similarly for hotfixes. Version tags are named 'blither-Version' instead of 'Version'.
